# Dr. Khan Website Interview Questions

To make this website truly stand out from generic medical sites, we need Dr. Khan's personal voice and specific policy details.

Please ask Dr. Khan these questions. Her answers (even rough notes) will help us write rich, authentic content.

    *   *Do you lean heavily on meds? do you prefer a 'start low and go slow' approach (especially with seniors)?*
3.  **"What is your approach to 'Treatment-Resistant' cases?"**
    *   *When standard meds don't work, how do you think through the problem? (Mentioning TMS/ECT expertise here is good).*
